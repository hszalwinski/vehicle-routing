# Data module
A place for input and output data of all types!

## 

# Algorithms output
This folder is created to contain database like files, where output of each algorithm will be saved.
Any new run of algorithm will:
- create a file if it not exists
- add a row with execution statistics 

This directory is a default one. Of course, the default output file path can be overwritten.
