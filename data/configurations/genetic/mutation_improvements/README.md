# Aims

* Improve results by modifying mutation in genetic algorithm. 
'mutated_sequences_ratio' has impact here.
* Find best results in ~5 seconds for 30 locations. 

'iterations_count' and 'population_size' values were chosen 
based on results from 'max_5_sec' directory (file II.json). 
'elite_sequences_ratio' and 'tournament_group_size' values were chosen
based on results from 'selection_improvements' directory (file I-chosen.json).
'pmx_crossing_ratio' value were chosen
based on results from 'crossing_improvements' directory (file III.json).
