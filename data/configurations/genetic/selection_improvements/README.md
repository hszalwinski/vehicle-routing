# Aims

* Improve results from genetic selection. 
'elite_sequences_ratio' and 'tournament_group_size' have impact here.
* Find best results in ~5 seconds for 30 locations. 

'iterations_count' and 'population_size' values were chosen 
based on results from 'max_5_sec' directory (file II.json). 
Other parameter values are set based on algorithm knowledge and 
experience gained while using this program.
